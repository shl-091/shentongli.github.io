                    - Utilized the AARRR model and RFM model for data analysis, drew conclusions and provided actionable 
                    recommendations. Findings indicate a gradual decline in daily new user counts, with a slight increase observed post 
                    launch of marketing campaigns, demonstrated positive impact on user acquisition.<br/>

                    on improving user loyalty and encouraging increased purchase frequency given the saturated market conditions; 
                    proposed strategies to expand user base through outreach in smaller cities and targeting wider age demographics.</p>

                <h3>Project 1: Exploration of Recipes on Food.com | Univariate/Bivariate Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Data Training</h3>
                <p>- Cooperated with a partner, scraping data from <a href="https://www.food.com/">Food.com</a> to get the user's overall feedback of recipes on 
                    the website. <br/>
                    - By building a model, we predicted the calories of a recipe due to people's pursue of healthier diet. <br/>
                    - Used Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis, Assessment of Missingness, and Hypothesis Testing to analyze user's 
                    rating of recipes. The detailed information can be found here: <a href="https://xgui17.github.io/Recipe-Analysis/"> Food Exploration! </a><br/>
                    - Used Linear-Regression type of model, K-fold Cross-validation, and Fairness Analysis to construct the model which 
                    can predict the calorie. The detailed information can be found here: <a href="https://xgui17.github.io/Predicting-Calories/"> Predicting Calories!</a>

                <h3>Project 2: Visualizing Airbnb Market Insights in London | HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Data Interactive Visualization</h3>
                <p>- Developed website with interactive visualizations to analyze and understand the Airbnb market in London, using a 
                    comprehensive Airbnb dataset. <br/>
                    - Designed a network visualization illustrating the advantages and disadvantages of different accommodation areas. <br/>
                    - Created a guest satisfaction map, visually representing average satisfaction scores across different regions in London. <br/></p>

                <h3>Project 3: Pfizer Vaccine Effectiveness | Permutation Testing, Choropleth, Assessment of Missingness</h3>
                <p>- Gathered data and used Choropleth to calculate what is the average number of doses received in each country. <br/>
                    - Focused on data of Israeli vaccinated using the Pfizer vaccine to discuss whether the Pfizer vaccine is no longer 
                    effective against serious illness, or if getting the vaccine will increase the risk of sickness. <br/>
                    - Solving MCAR and using permutation testing, I got the conclusion that the effectiveness of the vaccine within each 
                    age group is higher than the overall effectiveness. In fact, the effectiveness of every age group is above 80%, and for 
                    most age groups it is above 90%. <br/>
                    - Using Plotly, learned that the reason for Simpson's paradox mentioned above comes from the fact that, for each 
                    dosage level, the sickness rate of older people is greater than the sickness rate for younger people.</p>
